# Python metrics

## `code_coverage.py`

Reads a `coverage.py` JSON report (generated by `coverage json`) and prints a single number:

- output: percent covered (0–100)
- input: `coverage.json` by default, or pass a path as the first arg

Example:

```sh
coverage run -m pytest
coverage json -o coverage.json
python3 code_coverage.py coverage.json
```
